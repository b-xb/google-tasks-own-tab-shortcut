## Additional information

The link above allows you to open Google Tasks in it's own tab or window in your web browser.

An extension does not need to be downloaded in order to access this page.

I am providing the link here for convenience sake, for myself and anyone else.

You may wish to bookmark this link, either by dragging the link to your bookmarks or "right clicking" the link.

That is all.

Hopefully this link will not expire. If it does, please do let me know.
